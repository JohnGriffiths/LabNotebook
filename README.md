# LabNotebook

This is the host repository for my open, digital, research 'lab' notebook. 

The LabNotebook is a website / technical blog, built using [Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable) and hosted in [the usual github style](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages/) via the gh-pages branch of this repository. 

***The actual site can + should be accessed at https://johngriffiths.github.io/LabNotebook, not the raw github repo site pages you are currently reading*** 

If you're visiting for the first time, you probably will find it useful to read through the [posts](https://johngriffiths.github.io/LabNotebook/tag/labnotebook.html) about the LabNotebook entries format and objectives (or just click on the ['About' link](https://johngriffiths.github.io/LabNotebook/about-the-notebook.html) on the main page).

Enjoy!
